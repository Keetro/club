Do you not know what you want to do in life? Are you a jack-of-all-trades with interest in marketing, sales, human resources, and events? Then you might be just the one person we've been looking for.

At Keetro our mission is to promote professional person-to-person conversations. As a society, we are spending more and more time conversing over email every year; despite the technology, it is a lot harder to meet people in-person. And the world is just getting noisier - best ideas no longer reach their target audiences. Let's change that.

## APPRENTICESHIP ROLE (PAID):

As an Apprentice, your role is to change the world one person at a time. For most job ads, this would have a complete BS, but in our case we truly believe this is what this role is about. And as a world changer, you will be fundamental to our success, helping us reinvent how events are organized around the world.

Your day will usually begin with a brief sync-up and a coffee. You will then be given a list of people who showed interest in one of our initiatives. Your job for the day will be to contact these people and welcome them to the next phase of their personal journey. You are successful when everyone you touch feels like "it is about them" - never about you or us.

Over a period of two-three months, you will work with us at our Seattle downtown, WeWork Labs office, where you will write emails and make phone calls with an ultimate goal to grow our event marketing mission.

If successful, you will have an option to continue working with us full-time or get a referred to our network of start-up Chief Marketing Officers.

## ABOUT YOU:

You've probably worked at one point in your life in Hospitality Industry (Restaurant, Hotel), but then got excited about tech and considered working in Recruiting, Sales, or Executive Assistance. As a result, you are a strong multi-tasker who thrives in a fast paced-environment. And you are keen on embracing latest tactics--never afraid of the consequences--because that's who you are: fearless. If something does not work out, you try again. And again. And again...

## REQUIREMENTS:

* Advanced User of LinkedIn
* Excellent written and spoken communication
* Poses flexibility to adjust communication styles up and down as needed
* Humble

## PERKS:

* Define your own career. We are just getting started. No role is a final role.
* Have the credibility behind your back to tell friends/family that you are part of a truly mission-driven start-up (we are a non-profit organization)
