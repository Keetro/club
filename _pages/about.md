  Keetro Club was created to help you: <br>
  • Work on paid projects that teach high-demand skills<br>
  • Gain transferable experience in Growth Marketing activities<br>
  • Build a network of Keetro Club members and mentors<br>
  • Forge a more fulfilling career path
more-detailed-explanations: Our Origins <br>Keetro Club was created to fill the need
  we saw for high-quality marketing training for sales professionals. Our own experiences
  had shown us how many SDRs were stagnating in their careers. Our goal was to forge
  a new path where ambitious sales professionals could bolster their marketing credentials
  and take their career to the next level. Keetro is a place where we can learn from
  each other and escape the traditional pitfalls of being an SDR. <br>

feature1: "<h4>Non-Profit</h4> <p>Keetro Club is based on win-win dynamic. It's not
  a marketing agency - all activities are meant to benefit the members. Keetro Club
  is all about giving each growth associate opportunities for professional and personal
  growth, rather than earning profit for an owner.</p>"

feature2: "<h4>In-person Connections</h4> <p>Through professional events and networking opportunities,
  Keetro.org seeks to resolve the issues of isolation created by the abundance of
  technology in our modern world. Keetro Club members work at promoting and propagating
  these events through various marketing mechanisms.</p>"

feature3: "<h4>Offering SDRs a Marketing Career Path</h4> <p>SDRs play a critical role in every company. They are ambassador to every brand. However, it has become all too common that SDRs aren't offered career advancement and end up stagnating in their roles. Competition for roles as an SDR manager or account executive are fierce. Studies show that of all SDRs recently advanced into account executives, 40% are fired within the first year for poor performance (see Bridge Group study).</p>"
