Youâ€™re a misfit, business dev. jack-of-all-trades, poses high resourcefulness and ability to tell people exactly what and when they need to hear it. You should have a strong bias towards action.

You've probably worked at one point in your life as a Hostess or Hotel Concierge, but then got excited about tech and currently work either in Recruiting or Sales. As a result, you are a strong multi-tasker who thrives in a fast paced-environment. And you are keen on embracing latest tactics--never being afraid of the consequences--because that's who you are: fearless. If something does not work out, you try again. And again. And again...

## About Keetro.org

We are spending more time conversing over email every year; despite the technology, it is a lot harder to meet people in-person. And the world is just getting noisier - best ideas no longer reach their target audiences. Let's change that.
