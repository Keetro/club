problem_outline: "<h2>The SDR Problem</h2><p class=\\\"lead\\\">- If you’re an SDR,
  you know the critical role you play in your company’s success. In most cases, you’re
  the first direct contact your prospects have with your brand. Too often, however,
  you end up stuck without avenues for advancement in your organization. <br> Maybe
  you’re hoping to become an SDR manager or account executive, but the ratio of SDR’s
  versus AE’s and managers is such that the competition for those positions is fierce.
  Worse, a report commissioned by the Bridge Group indicates that 40% of SDR’s who
  become AE’s are fired due to poor performance within the first year. <br>- How Can
  We Help? <br>  \n“If you want them to stay longer, you’ve got to give them a career
  path. What they really want is not a new title; they want new skills to add to their
  resume.” - Trish Bertuzzi, President & Chief Strategist, The Bridge Group.<br>\n
  \n<br>What if you could constantly learn new transferable skills so that if and
  when an AE or other management position becomes available, you’re perfectly positioned
  to succeed with a leg up on the competition? <br>\n \n<h3> Solution <h3/> <p class=\\\"lead\\\">In
  the event that you find your career progress at a standstill with no available pathways
  for advancement, Keetro Club is here to provide you with another way forward. <br>

  career path. <br> </p>\n\n<h4>- Become a Growth Associate<h4/>\n<br>- If you’re
  not satisfied with the trajectory of your career, you have two choices: continue
  to languish and wait for a growth opportunity that may never come, or be proactive
  and give yourself a chance to grow and thrive.<br>\nWe’re here for those who choose
  the latter option.\nWe hope you’re one of them.\n <br></p>\n"
