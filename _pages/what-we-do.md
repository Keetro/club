problem_outline: "<h2>The SDR Problem</h2><p class=\"lead\">\nSDRs play a critical
  role in every company and serve as the first point of direct contact with prospects.
  You are the ambassador to your brand. \nHowever, it has become all too common that
  SDRs aren't offered career advancement and end up stagnating in their roles. \nCompetition
  for roles as an SDR manager or account executive are fierce, and getting an edge
  is extremely difficult. Even for the SDRs who do manage to advance, studies show
  that 40% of recently advanced account executives are fired within the first year
  for poor performance (see Bridge Group study). </p>\n\n<h2>Getting the Right Skills</h2>\nThe
  outlook for most SDRs isn’t too promising.<br> \n\nAccording to a report done by
  the Bridge Group (a B2B sales consulting companY), ⅓ of entry-level SDR’s fail to
  hit their quota. And then, up to 40% of those SDRs who do get promoted to the account
  executive position are fired in just their first year due to poor performance. <br>\n\nMuch
  of this can be attributed to a lack of relevant skills, since being an account executive
  is very different from being an SDR. But what can we do about this?<br>\n\n\n<p
  class=\"lead\">“If you want them to stay longer, you’ve got to give them a career
  path. What they really want is not a new title; they want new skills to add to their
  resume.” - Trish Bertuzzi, President & Chief Strategist, The Bridge Group.<br>\n\n<h2>How
  Can We Help?</h2>\n\nSkills must be emphasized to help these SDRs to grow. Currently,
  new hires get 2-4 weeks of training on the job and their skill acquisition ends
  there. Employers stop providing the time or resources to learn and develop new skills,
  and this leads to SDRs spending years in the same role. <br>\n\nIf they aren’t given
  the opportunity to develop a skill set within their role, what would happen if they
  did it outside of their role? <br>\n\nThis is where Keetro Club comes in with tons
  of powerful growth opportunities where they can learn new skills that will transfer
  to their ideal job, gain experience, and build their network.<br>\n\n \n<br>What
  if you could constantly learn new transferable skills that position you perfectly
  for any AE or management positions that become available? <br>\n\nGetting a leg
  up on the competition is the goal, and we have the solution for you.<br>\n </p>\n<blockquote>\nIf
  your career is at a standstill with no available pathways for advancement, Keetro
  Club has another way forward. \n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"lead\">\n<br> \nKeetro
  Club will help you:\n <br>\n• Take on projects that help you learn new transferable
  skills <br>\n• Gain experience in Growth Marketing activities <br>\n• Build your
  network through fellow Keetro Club members<br>\n• Forge your own career path and
  escape the SDR trap <br> \n</p>\n\n<h2>Become a Growth Associate</h2>\n<p class=\"lead\">If
  you’re not satisfied with the current trajectory of your career, it's time to do
  something about it. You have two choices: continue to languish and wait for the
  dream opportunity that may never come... <br>\n<br>\nOr be proactive and give yourself
  a chance to grow and thrive.<br>\nWe’re here for those who choose the latter option.<br>\n<br>\nWe
  hope you’re one of them.<br>\n <br></p>\n"

problem_outline: "<h2>Advancing as SDR is Problematic</h2><p class=\"lead\">All too common that SDRs aren't offered career advancement and end up stagnating in their roles. Studies show that of all SDRs recently advanced into account executives, 40% are fired within the first year for poor performance (see Bridge Group study). <br/><br/>And only 2/3 of entry-level SDRs hit the (ever-increasing) Quota.</p>

<h2>What you need is time to develop new skills</h2><p class=\"lead\">
SDRs are quick to learn the tools and skills required for a new job (2-4 weeks), but that is usually where it ends. Employers often don't provide the time or resources to help you continue learn and develop new skills. You end up spending years in the same role, without having the time to develop a skillset needed to pursue opportunities for advancement.
