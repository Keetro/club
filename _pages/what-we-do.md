problem_outline: "<h2>The SDR Problem</h2><p class=\\\"lead\\\">\nSDRs play a critical
  role in every company and serve as the first point of direct contact with prospects.
  You are the ambassador to your brand. \nHowever, it has become all too common that
  SDRs aren't offered career advancement and end up stagnating in their roles. \nCompetition
  for roles as an SDR manager or account executive are fierce, and getting an edge
  is extremely difficult. Even for the SDRs who do manage to advance, studies show
  that 40% of recently advanced account executives are fired within the first year
  for poor performance (see Bridge Group study). \n\n<h2>How Can We Help?</h2>\n“If
  you want them to stay longer, you’ve got to give them a career path. What they really
  want is not a new title; they want new skills to add to their resume.” - Trish Bertuzzi,
  President & Chief Strategist, The Bridge Group.<br>\n \n<br>What if you could constantly
  learn new transferable skills that position you perfectly for any AE or management
  positions that become available? \n\nGetting a leg up on the competition is the
  goal, and we have the solution for you.<br>\n \n<blockquote>\nIf your career is
  at a standstill with no available pathways for advancement, Keetro Club has another
  way forward. \n</blockquote>\n<br> Keetro Club will help you: <br>\n• Take on projects
  that help you learn new transferable skills <br>\n• Gain experience in Growth Marketing
  activities <br>\n• Build your network through fellow Keetro Club members<br>\n•
  Forge your own career path and escape the SDR trap <br> </p>\n\n<h2>Become a Growth
  Associate<h2/>\n<br>If you’re not satisfied with the current trajectory of your
  career, it's time to do something about it. You have two choices: continue to languish
  and wait for the dream opportunity that may never come... <br>\n<br>\nOr be proactive
  and give yourself a chance to grow and thrive.<br>\nWe’re here for those who choose
  the latter option.<br>\n<br>\nWe hope you’re one of them.<br>\n <br></p>\n"
